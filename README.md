# Todo web api
[![Build Status](https://build.dovydasvenckus.com/api/badges/dovydasvenckus/todo-api/status.svg)](https://build.dovydasvenckus.com/dovydasvenckus/todo-api)

Lightweight simple todo list web api.

This is my pet project. This application uses just a handful of lightweight libs. I have chosen this approach for the sake of discovering pain points that heavy frameworks (Spring, Hibernate) and  other libs solve.

In this project I'm using an existing HTTP server, JSON parsing or security libs. 

## Disclaimer
This project doesn't reflect my values as a software developer. In this project I might be "reinventing the bicycle" just for the sake of implementing it and learning how to solve some problems without external libs.
